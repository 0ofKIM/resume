## Docs

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize. Much Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file, and most of the content configuration will take place in the `/_layouts/resume.html` file

### Running locally

To test locally, run the following in your terminal:

1. Clone repo locally
1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open your browser to `localhost:4000`
